## 1. Show your knowledge in your profile

Upwork has [**general knowledge**](https://www.upwork.com/hire/). Find the ones that apply to you and add them to your profile. Choosing these correctly will increase your chances of getting a job in this field.

Choose up to 15 skills and knowledge this way. When choosing, consider how well you know this knowledge and how important it is in your field.

You can change this list later as you learn new skills.

## 2. Choose the right profile picture

Your profile picture is the first thing a customer sees, so choosing the right profile picture is very important. Here [**here**](https://www.upwork.com/resources/how-to-guide-perfect-profile-picture) has more information on this.

In short, you should be yourself in your profile picture. The image should be clear. It is also not recommended to be too serious and too funny. Your face should be fully visible.

## 3. Show your knowledge and skills in your profile

Consider what customers are looking for when choosing a title. Because if the keyword your customers are searching for is in your Title, you will appear in the search results.

The first 2 sentences are important when writing an overview, because this initial part will be visible when your profile appears in search results. therefore, write about the most important information, mainly about your experience, at the beginning of the overview.

## 4. Create a great introduction video

Creating a video will set you apart because 90% of freelancers don't have a video. And it is interesting for customers to know about you and it increases their trust.

Creating a video can seem daunting and difficult. In this case, I advise you to write down what you say. Talk about your knowledge and skills.

If you need motivation:

## 5. Show your best work

Show examples of your projects and work in the portfolio section. This part is very important for those just starting out on Upwork, as in most cases clients will want to see examples of your previous work. Increase the client's trust in you by showing your best work.

Also, write about how you did each job, how you overcame the difficulties at work.

## 6. Show your certificates and achievements

There is a special section in your profile to display your industry-specific certifications. You can prove how well you know this field by showing certificates.

**Pro Tip:** Many clients are looking for freelancers who speak English fluently, if you have an IELTS certificate, don't forget to add that too.

## 7. Write your work history

Be sure to write down about your previous workplace and duties. It gives the customer more information about you, about your experience.

You can write briefly about the tasks you performed, the period of work and the position. Do not forget to write about your achievements at work.

## 8. Write about your education level

You should reflect the information about the university, field and knowledge you studied in your profile.

You can also include a list of online courses you have completed.

If you have participated in research or extracurricular activities, you can add these to the "Other Experiences" section.

## 9. Additional tips for completing the profile

- Please recheck all information. There should be no spelling or grammatical errors.
- Enter information about your industry. Remove any other redundant or distracting information.

Before printing your profile, show it to your friends and make any necessary changes after getting their advice.
