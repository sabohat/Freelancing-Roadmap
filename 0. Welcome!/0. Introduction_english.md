## About the author

My name is Sabohat. I first stepped into programming when I was accepted to study at the International University of Westminster. And I studied programming regularly for 3 years. Yes, 3 years of regular study. During this time, I learned directly from people of Uzbek, Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian nationality, as well as watching video lessons of English and Indian programmers through YouTube, Udemy and similar platforms. The learning is not over yet. Currently, I am working as a Top Rated Freelancer at [Upwork](https://upwork.com) and a developer at [Barq](https://barqapp.com).

I also share my knowledge with hundreds of people through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbI_6MNsSe7uWTD6-xKItoQ) and [Telegram channel](https://t.me/easy_freelancing).

I think the tutorial you have now will help you step into the world of innovation. Through this course, I intend to share with you the experience and knowledge I have gained on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com).

## What is taught in the course

Industry: Freelance

Platform: Upwork

## A typical working day of a freelancer

Freelancers work in a variety of positions. This includes programming (Backend, Frontend), design, SMM, copy-writing, data-entry, project management and many other areas. Regardless of your industry, chances are you'll find a job on Upword that's right for you.

Given that I work as a Freelancer in the field of Frontend programming, let's talk about the typical agenda of a representative of this field in my example.

_I start work at 9:00 in the morning, I have lunch from 13:00 to 14:00 and then I work until 18:00._

**In fact, it is not! Freelancing gives you many benefits, including setting your own schedule.**

I start work on Upwork at 10am (from home). I am the first to talk to my clients and report on the work done (not every day, occasionally). My tasks are varied, so I never get bored. The projects and clients I work with change quickly (Upwork can work on 1-2 projects at a time, and when a project ends, I often start working on other projects with other clients).

I have lunch around 12-13:00 and continue my work. And after working for another 2 hours, I am often busy with other activities.

On days when I have classes at the university, I set aside 2-3 hours in the evening for Upwork. The work schedule and amount of work varies, some days I devote less hours to Upwork, sometimes more hours.

Whenever I run into a problem, I ask Google/Stackoverflow and other developers in the group for advice. I pay a lot of attention to the client when choosing a job, and this ensures that the job goes smoothly.

As you can see, when I work part time, I get a good salary due to the high hourly rate. Actually, not monthly but "Weekly" because Upwork gives you the money you collect every week.

## What result is expected at the end of the course

After successfully completing the course, you will be able to earn money using your knowledge and experience on the Upwork platform. If you can fully master the topics taught in each section of the course and complete the assigned tasks, you can get the "Rising Talent" level and your first job on Upwork.

In any case, as you begin this journey, I will do my best to help you find your way.

The course consists of 3 main parts. These are:

1. Create a profile that stands out on Upwork.

2. Job search.

3. Secrets of dealing with the client.

4. Bonus: Money matters and Upwork lifehacks.

<!-- ## Hints

**Get the right impression about freelancing**

When most people think of freelancers, they think of thousands of dollars in salary. However, this is not complete, it is necessary to add a few more components to get a full impression.

![Full Cycle of Programming](../Images/Diagram1.png "a title")

Each of these serves as a basis for the other. Any innovation takes years of work. In most cases, you work for free. There isn't a single program like Facebook, Instagram, or anything else where the people they introduced to the world didn't work for free for a period of time.

So, if we have understood the place of patience, now let's talk about _impartial intention_, which is the fuel of this patience. If you don't have a vision bigger than yourself, you might not have the patience to spend years learning how to program and then sitting around innovating without making any money.

Depending on each person's world view, beliefs and principles in life, this larger goal can be different. For example, a student who saw his parents who gave everything for their child, who worked day and night to bring him to maturity and find his own way, will learn faster from his siblings. and can work hard on the educational platform to get a place in life sooner. -->
