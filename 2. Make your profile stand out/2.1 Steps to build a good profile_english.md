### What should a good profile look like?

So what kind of profile do we want it to have? What would a good profile look like?

To find out, browse the profiles of other freelancers in your industry on Upwork. Pay attention to how the profiles of the most successful freelancers stand out from the rest. At the same time, it is not correct to imitate them and copy them word for word. But this is a great opportunity to gain insight into filling out a profile.


- You can view the profiles of other freelancers and make small changes to your liking.
- Ensure that the profile is visible to the public ("profile visibility" should be "public")
- Enter your profiles on other platforms in your profile settings so that Upwork starts showing you more in the search results.
- Turn on the additional "available" badge, which will greatly help in finding the first job.
